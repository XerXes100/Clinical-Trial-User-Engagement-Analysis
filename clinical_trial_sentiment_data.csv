Post,"Bleeding on birth control, particularly after orgasm? Uterine polyps?  
F20, USA
Medications: Started Loryna in August of 2023 
Medical history: Never have been sexually active with another partner. 

I have been on Loryna for a solid year and a few months now. I got sick this past February that triggered some breakthrough bleeding that lasted a while before I ended up skipping a placebo week and it kind of sorted itself out. 

I also finished my semester and was significantly less stressed. It was fine for a few months.


This past month I once again started spotting/lightly bleeding and it's been 2ish weeks. It’s not more than enough to use more than one pad a day. No where near enough for a tampon.  I skipped straight into the current pack I'm on now and I have been bleeding still.


Should I take the placebos at the end of this pack (4 pills) to give my body a bit of a break to bleed and then start again?


I will say these past few weeks I've taken the pill not as strict, where I can be several hours late. I've been so slammed and sometimes I forget to at work, school, when I'm studying, etc. so I am not sure if that has something to do with it?? I am also once again, stressed as hell.


On top of that, I am a little freaked out about the possibility of uterine polyps. I was bleeding a little already, but I noticed that when I masturbate (external with vibrator, usually 2ish orgasms) and then use the bathroom, it looks like I'm on my period. I am not sure if it's just because I exaggerated the bleeding I was already having, or if it's something to be really worried about. Google says uterine polyps and that’s really freaking me out. It usually stops soon after and returns to spotting.

I was in a car accident last year where I fractured ( all same side ) my fibula, dislocated my knee ( no idea about tendon damage, I know two minor tendons are still not in place yet ), dislocated my hip, fractured my pelvis, and cracked six ribs.

Post,"UNSOLVED: Seeking Advice on Persistent Testicular Discomfort, Been suffering from years Hello everyone, it driving me crazy,

I've been experiencing an issue with discomfort in my testicles for the past two years, and I'm trying to understand what might be causing it. Here are some details about the situation:

* **Symptoms:** The discomfort (or ""hitching"") occurs whether I'm wearing clothes or not, but it seems to be worse with contact and friction. During sports, I often notice it at the beginning of the activity, but it doesn’t happen every time.
* **Variability:** Some days the discomfort is minimal, while on others, it can be quite pronounced.
* **Physical Examination:** I’ve checked for any apparent skin conditions or parasites, and my skin looks normal. I’ve also tried hydrating the area, but that doesn’t seem to alleviate the problem.
* **History:** This issue began when I was 15 years old, and I’m currently 17.

Based on my observations, I have a few theories about potential causes:

1. Dietary factors
2. Stress or anxiety
3. Possible allergic reactions (though I don’t think that’s likely)
4. An underlying condition that isn’t visually apparent
5. Something else entirely (probably cause i tried to test those previous ideas) 

  
I already saw a general practitioner, but he didn't notice anything, and it didn't lead to any progress. I have no idea what to do, and it's hard to focus in school when things are on fire.

  
I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions on what this could be or what steps I should take next. Thank you!",-0.9692,"['UNSOLVED', 'years', 'the past two years', 'Some days', '15 years old', '17', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5']",True,2024-11-03 16:01:13,1.0,Low,"Hi there,
